# Keybindings

Run `/hotkeys` inside an `gjc` session to see the active chords for your current build. The list reflects any remaps loaded from disk and any bindings added by extensions.

## Customize keybindings

User remaps live in `~/.gjc/agent/keybindings.json`. The file is a JSON object whose keys are keybinding action IDs and whose values are either one chord string or an array of chord strings. It is not read from `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml`, and there is no nested `keybindings` object.

```json
{
  "app.commandPalette.open": "Ctrl+P",
  "app.model.cycleForward": "Alt+N",
  "app.model.selectTemporary": "Alt+P",
  "app.plan.toggle": "Alt+Shift+P"
}
```

Chord names are case-insensitive and use the same notation shown in the UI, such as `Ctrl+P`, `Alt+N`, `Alt+Shift+P`, `Shift+Enter`, and `Ctrl+Backspace`.

Set an action to an empty array to disable it:

```json
{
  "app.stt.toggle": []
}
```

## Common action IDs

| Action ID | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app.commandPalette.open` | `Ctrl+P` | Open the command palette |
| `app.model.cycleForward` | `Alt+N` | Cycle role models forward |
| `app.model.cycleBackward` | `Alt+Shift+N` | Cycle role models backward |
| `app.model.selectTemporary` | `Alt+P` | Pick a model temporarily for this session |
| `app.model.select` | `Ctrl+L` | Open the model selector and set roles |
| `app.plan.toggle` | `Alt+Shift+P` | Toggle plan mode |
| `app.history.search` | `Ctrl+R` | Search prompt history |
| `app.tools.expand` | `Ctrl+O` | Toggle tool-output expansion |
| `app.thinking.toggle` | `Ctrl+T` | Toggle thinking-block visibility |
| `app.thinking.cycle` | `Shift+Tab` | Cycle thinking level |
| `app.editor.external` | `Ctrl+G` | Edit the draft in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` |
| `app.message.followUp` | _(none)_ | Optional remap for a follow-up message; `Ctrl+Enter` is reserved for editor newline |
| `app.message.queue` | `Alt+Enter` (`Alt+Q` on darwin/win32) | Explicitly queue a message for the next turn |
| `app.message.dequeue` | `Alt+Up` | Dequeue a queued message back into the editor |

| `app.clipboard.copyLine` | `Alt+Shift+L` | Copy the current line |
| `app.clipboard.copyPrompt` | `Alt+Shift+C` | Copy the whole prompt |
| `app.stt.toggle` | `Alt+H` | Toggle speech-to-text recording |
| `app.irc.sidebar.toggle` | `Alt+I` | Toggle IRC sidebar |

Older unqualified action names are migrated when `keybindings.json` is loaded, but new docs and new configs should use the namespaced action IDs above.

On macOS and native Windows terminals, GJC defaults `app.message.queue` to `Alt+Q`; Windows Terminal and PowerShell commonly reserve `Alt+Enter` for fullscreen before GJC can receive it. Users who prefer another chord can remap `app.message.queue` in `~/.gjc/agent/keybindings.json`.

In the main GJC composer, plain `PageUp` / `PageDown` page the visible transcript viewport instead of browsing prompt history; use `Up` / `Down` or `Ctrl+R` for prompt history. Autocomplete and selector surfaces still use `PageUp` / `PageDown` for list paging while they have focus.

## Auditing default-key collisions

Some default chords are intentionally reused across different UI contexts, where the focused component disambiguates them at dispatch time. For example `Enter` maps to both input submit and selection confirm, and `Ctrl+C` maps to both input copy and selection cancel. These are not conflicts — only one context is active at a time.

To audit the registry for keys whose default binding is claimed by more than one action, use `detectDefaultKeyCollisions(definitions)` from `@gajae-code/tui/keybindings`. It returns one entry per colliding key with the list of claiming action IDs, which is useful when adding new defaults or reviewing the surface. User-remap conflicts (multiple actions bound to the same chord in `keybindings.json`) continue to be reported separately by `KeybindingsManager.getConflicts()`.

Two audit clarifications for the current surface:

- `app.clipboard.copyLine` is registry-backed and dispatched through the input controller's custom key handlers, not hardcoded.
- `tui.input.copy` is declared in the registry but is not currently dispatched by `Editor.handleInput`.

The editor's configurable action defaults (including the platform-aware `app.clipboard.pasteImage` default) are derived directly from the central `KEYBINDINGS` registry, so there is a single source of truth for those defaults.

## Current surface audit

Authoritative inventory of the keybinding registry, one row per action. Generated from `TUI_KEYBINDINGS` (`packages/tui/src/keybindings.ts`) and `KEYBINDINGS` (`packages/coding-agent/src/config/keybindings.ts`). Every action ID below is remappable via `~/.gjc/agent/keybindings.json` unless noted. A drift test (`packages/coding-agent/test/keybindings-audit.test.ts`) asserts every registry action ID appears in this table.

### Global engine context (`tui.global.*`)

| Action ID | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tui.global.debug` | `shift+ctrl+d` | Toggle debug overlay; resolved through the registry in `tui.ts` |

Cross-context default reuse (`ctrl+s`, `ctrl+r`, `ctrl+d`, `ctrl+b`, `ctrl+left`/`ctrl+right`, `enter`, `escape`, `ctrl+c`) is intentional: each pair is active in a different focused context and is disambiguated at dispatch time. Use `detectDefaultKeyCollisions()` (above) to re-derive this list from the registry.

### Not yet registry-managed

A few contexts still match chords directly instead of resolving through the registry, and are tracked for a later phase:

- Tree selector (`tree-selector.ts`): up/down/left/right/enter, `ctrl+c`, filter cycling (`ctrl+o` / `ctrl+shift+o`), filter modes (`alt+d/t/u/l/a`), label edit (`shift+l`).
- Parts of the model selector.
