Executes bash command in shell session for terminal operations like git, bun, cargo, python.

<instruction>
- Use `cwd` to set working directory, not `cd dir && …`
{{#when restrictionProfile "==" "read-only"}}
- Do not pass `env` overrides or `pty: true`; read-only bash rejects both.
- Shell control operators such as `;`, `|`, `&`, `<`, `>`, and command substitution are blocked.
- Internal URIs (`agent://`, `artifact://`, `rule://`, `local://`) are auto-resolved to filesystem paths without creating parent directories.
{{else}}
- Prefer `env: { NAME: "…" }` for multiline, quote-heavy, or untrusted values; reference as `$NAME`
- Quote variable expansions like `"$NAME"` to preserve exact content
- PTY mode is opt-in: set `pty: true` only when the command needs a real terminal (e.g. `sudo`, `ssh` requiring user input); default is `false`
- Use `;` only when later commands should run regardless of earlier failures
- Internal URIs (`agent://`, `artifact://`, `rule://`, `local://`) are auto-resolved to filesystem paths
{{/when}}
{{#if asyncEnabled}}
- Use `async: true` for long-running commands when you don't need immediate output; the call returns a background job ID and the result is delivered automatically as a follow-up.
{{/if}}
{{#if autoBackgroundEnabled}}
- In the interactive TUI, the user can press `Ctrl+B` twice while a supported managed foreground bash command is still running to fold it into a quiet background job. Do not instruct users to use raw shell `Ctrl+Z`/`bg` inside the GJC TUI; ownership and output routing are not safe there.

<restricted-bash-mode>
{{#when restrictionProfile "==" "read-only"}}
This session's bash tool is read-only. It accepts only simple, single-command inspections beginning with:
{{#each restrictedAllowedPrefixes}}
- `{{this}}`
{{/each}}
Shell control operators, command substitution, env overrides, redirects, pipelines, glob expansion, and known write-capable flags are blocked before execution. Use it only when an inspection command is materially better than `read`, `search`, or `find`.
{{else}}
This session's bash tool is restricted. It only accepts commands beginning with:
{{#each restrictedAllowedPrefixes}}
- `{{this}}`
{{/each}}
Use it only for sanctioned GJC workflow CLI persistence or state read/write/contract operations; the only per-command env override allowed is `GJC_RALPLAN_ARTIFACT` when paired with `gjc ralplan --write ... --artifact-env GJC_RALPLAN_ARTIFACT`, and all other shell command shapes are blocked before execution.

{{/if}}

<critical>
{{#when restrictionProfile "==" "read-only"}}
- Use read-only bash only for approved inspection commands that are materially better than dedicated tools; unsafe shell shapes are blocked.
{{else}}
- Use bash only for terminal operations that dedicated tools do not cover.
{{/when}}
- Never pipe through `| head -n N` or `| tail -n N` — output is already truncated with the full result available via `artifact://<id>`.
- Never redirect with `2>&1` or `2>/dev/null` — stdout and stderr are already merged.
</critical>

<output>
- Returns output and exit code.
- Truncated output is retrievable from `artifact://<id>` (linked in metadata)
- Exit codes shown on non-zero exit
</output>

{{#if asyncEnabled}}
# Timeout and async

- `timeout` (seconds) caps the **wall-clock duration** of the command. When it elapses the process is killed and the call returns with a timeout annotation. Range: `1`–`3600`s; default `300`s.
- `async: true` only defers **reporting** of the result — it does NOT disable, extend, or detach the timeout. A daemon started with `async: true` is still killed when `timeout` elapses, regardless of how long the agent waits before reading the result.
- For long-running daemons (dev servers, watchers): either pass an explicit large `timeout` (up to `3600`), or fully detach the process from this shell using `nohup …  &` / `setsid … &` / `disown` so it survives independent of the bash call's lifecycle.
{{/if}}

# Output minimizer

- Bash stdout/stderr may be rewritten before you see it: long output is head/tail truncated, and test/lint runners (e.g. `bun test`, `cargo test`, ESLint) are passed through heuristic filters that drop noise and keep failures.
- When the minimizer changes the visible text, the tool appends a `[raw output: artifact://<id>]` footer pointing at the **full untouched capture**. If a run looks suspicious (e.g. only a version banner) or you need the exact bytes, read that artifact.
- If no footer is present, what you see is what the command actually emitted.
